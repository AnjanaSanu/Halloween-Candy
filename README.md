# Candy Power Ranking

### Overview

A renowned SuperMarket chain wants to expand their candy offering. These are store brand candies that they sell along the brand offerings. The idea is to create a brand new product. The team is discussing various options at the moment.

Some prefer cookie-based sweets while others think that it should be gummies. The Divisional Director responsible for purchasing has decided to use a more data-driven approach. He contracted with a market research group to collect data on products in the market and their characteristics and customer sentiment.

In this project, an analytical approach is developed using machine learning models to find out which product characteristics drive customer sentiment and subsequently make a recommendation on a new product.

### The Project
The project includes two files:
*	The Ipython notebook with the code [Notebook](https://github.com/AnjanaSanu/Halloween-Candy/blob/master/Halloween_Candy.ipynb)
